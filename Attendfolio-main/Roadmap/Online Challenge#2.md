We prepared to attempt 2 questions in 30 Mins were to attempt both of the questions,
but At the last min, It changed to 1 Question for 30 minutes. Some of the students got to 
choose an option and comment on their understandings whereas some got just to choose an option out of the 4 options.
Questions were mostly easy to medium level.
